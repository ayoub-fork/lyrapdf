# Lyrapdf: convert a PDF to JSON or MarkDown

Lyrapdf is a project based on [PDFMiner.Six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six),
which extracts text from a PDF document and processes it so the original
structure from the text is reconstructed.

The output format can be MarkDown or JSON.

```
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Also, some libraries must be installed:

This repository also includes a Natural Lenguage Understanding proof of concept
