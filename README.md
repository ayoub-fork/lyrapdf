# Lyrapdf: convert a PDF to JSON or MarkDown

Lyrapdf is a project based on [PDFMiner.Six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six),
which extracts text from a PDF document and processes it so the original
structure from the text is reconstructed.

The output format can be MarkDown or JSON.

## Getting started

Download the repository or clone it:
```
git clone https://github.com/vpec/lyrapdf.git
```

In order to execute this project, **python3** is needed.
```
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Also, some libraries must be installed:

```
pip install pdfminer.six
pip install sspipe
```

To convert PDFs inside a directory to JSON (more information in [Usage examples](#usage-examples)) use:
```
python3 -m lyrapdf folder/with/pdfs
```

This repository also includes a Natural Lenguage Understanding proof of concept
in *docbot* directory, which uses the following dependencies:

```
pip install snips-nlu
```

## How it works

The original document is processed by a pipeline composed by multiple
processing steps until reaching the final output format: JSON. It's also
possible to get the output file in MarkDown format.

Almost all processing is based on the use of regular expressions. More details can
be found looking at the code, as each small step is contained inside a method.

## Features

### Keep only the content you actually need

It removes unnecessary elements as page numbers. This is made thanks to the position
inside the page provided by the HTML format.

### Smart text relevance

The whole text does not have the same relevance. Some words are titles, others are just... text.

A classification has been made based on the size of each text block.
All text that is contained within 95% of the cumulative character size 
within the document is considered standard. Larger sizes are considered titles.

For relevance of each title, several intervals have been established,
thanks to a deterministic and optimal version of the K-means algorithm.

The result of this process is a MarkDown document.

### Paragraph debugging

Text is debugged in order to get paragraphs merged into one line.
Some other small processing is done to remove defects from the text.

### Structured format

It is possible to obtain an output in JSON structured format, from a
conversion from MarkDown, where the level of relevance of the text
is indicated (1 is the most important, 7 is the standard text).

## Usage examples

I want to extract, process and convert to JSON text from PDFs inside a directory.
From git root directory, run:
```
python3 -m lyrapdf folder/with/pdfs
```

From git root directory, run:
```
python3 -m lyrapdf folder/with/pdfs --threads 4
```
